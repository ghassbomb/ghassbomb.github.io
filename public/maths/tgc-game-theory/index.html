    <p>These are problem solutions to <a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/understanding-economics-game-theory">a TTC/TGC course on game theory</a> by Jay R. Corrigan. The solutions are organized by lecture, of which there are twelve in total.</p>
<h2 id="lecture-one">Lecture One</h2>
<p>Q1: Find this game’s two pure-strategy Nash equilibrium outcomes.
Assume a higher payoff is better than a lower one. (Colin bolded, Rose the other).</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Left</th>
          <th>Right</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Up</td>
          <td>0,3</td>
          <td>10,10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Down</td>
          <td>2,1</td>
          <td>5,0</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>A1:
One outcome is Colin going right, while Rose goes up. This results in 10 units of payoff to each player, and there is no incentive to change since no other outcome rewards a greater outcome to either player.</p>
<p>The second outcome is Colin going left, and Rose going down. This results in a lower payoff.</p>
<p>Q2: Explain why this game is an example of a prisoner’s dilemma. Assume
a higher payoff is better than a lower one. (Colin bolded, Rose the other).</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Left</th>
          <th>Right</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Up</td>
          <td>2,2</td>
          <td>6,1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Down</td>
          <td>1,6</td>
          <td>5,5</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>A2:
This game is an example of prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma because there is an outcome where both participants can benefit equally, and for a greater total payoff (Colin goes right, Rose goes down). However, each participant can gain a greater <em>individual</em> payoff if they go another route (at the cost of the other), which each has to account for in their decision-making. If Colin and Rose do not trust each other, their dominant strategy is to go left and up respectively – losing out on a greater total and individual payoff.</p>
